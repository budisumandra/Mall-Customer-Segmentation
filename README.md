# Mall-Customer-Segmentation
Mall customers are segmented using the K-Means clustering model. The dataset can be downloaded at https://www.kaggle.com/vjchoudhary7/customer-segmentation-tutorial-in-python 
This Segmentation consists of 3 processes: 
- Pre-Processing (data exploration using boxplot visualization, normal distribution, and countplot; removing outliers with the Interquartile (IQR) method, removing columns that are not important for the model) 
- Modeling (Using K-means model) 
- Analysis of results and mapping of each cluster name (using boxplot and countplot visualization)
